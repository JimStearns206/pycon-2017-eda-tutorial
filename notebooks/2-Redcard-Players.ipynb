A summary of the variables of interest can be seen below. A detailed description of all variables included can be seen in the README file on the project website. \n",

We created a dataset of playerâ€“referee dyads including the number of matches players and referees encountered each other and our dependent variable, the number of red cards given to a player by a particular referee throughout all matches the two encountered each other.\n",
